- **[Scaling Snowflake Intelligence: A Practical Guide to Atomic Instructions](snowflake-intelligence-scaling-whitepaper.md)**

    Managing Hundreds of Semantic Views and AI Agents with Reusable Rules

    ## Abstract

    When managing Snowflake Intelligence at scale—dozens of semantic views and agents across multiple business domains—instruction management quickly becomes overwhelming. Instructions get duplicated across agents, business logic changes require hunting through hundreds of YAML files, and inconsistencies creep in.

    This whitepaper presents **Atomic Instructions**, a practical approach to managing Snowflake Intelligence configurations at scale by decomposing complex instructions into small, reusable rules. Based on real-world implementation, we show how atomic instructions enable teams to scale from 10 to 100+ semantic views and agents while maintaining consistency, traceability, and quality.

    **Target Audience:** Snowflake developers, data architects, and teams managing Snowflake Intelligence deployments.
